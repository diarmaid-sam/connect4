This is Pseudocode kinda for the whole program. Really vague, give me direction

Connect 4 basics:
- Game consists of a grid; 7 tiles across, 6 tiles up.
- tokens can only be placed from the bottom upwards and each player has their own token type
- 2 player game in which each person takes turns placing a token
- a player has to get 4 tokens in a row (connect 4) to win a game
- This can be diagonally, vertically or horizontally

What you might consider programming:
- the connect 4 grid as a 2d array

- function(s) which check if the 2d array has tokens in a row of 4
